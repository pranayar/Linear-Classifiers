# Linear-Classifiers using Python
In this colab notebook, I have shown the demonstration and explained Linear Classifiers with the help of Python.
The 4 types of linear classifiers explained are:
1. Logistic Regression: This is a binary classifier that uses the logistic function to predict the probability of a given input belonging to one of two classes.
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): This is a supervised learning method that is used to predict the class of a given input based on the linear combination of features.
3. Support Vector Machines (SVMs): These are a set of supervised learning models that can be used for classification, regression, and outlier detection. SVMs are based on the concept of finding a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates different classes.
4. Perceptron: This is a simple linear classifier that makes predictions based on the weighted sum of input features and a bias term.
